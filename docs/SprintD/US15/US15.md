# US 15 - To check and export vaccination statistics

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a center coordinator, I intended to check and export vaccination statistics. I want to export, to a csv file, the total number of fully vaccinated users per day.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications Document:**

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Is there any kind of format our exported data should follow

> **Answer:** Data format: date; number of fully vaccinated user.

> **Question:** Is the exportation of the CSV file that contains the total number of fully vaccinated users per day, the only feature that needs to be implemented in code, for US15?

> **Answer:** Yes.

> **Question:** Are the vaccination statistics refering only to the fully vaccinated users or refering to something more?

> **Answer:** Only to fully vaccinated users.

> **Question:** In this US should the Center Coordinator check and export the Vaccination Statistics of the Center where he/she works at or should just check and export the Vaccination Statistics of all centers?

> **Answer:** The center coordinator can only export statistics from the vaccination center that he coordinates
 


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The Date should follow the following format (dd/mm/yyyy);
* **AC2:** The exported file needs to have this format: date; number of vaccinated users.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency to US8.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * initial date
    * final date
    * name of the file
    
**Output Data:**
* list of users that were vaccinated in that day
* file with the number of vaccinated users in that day
* Success of the operation

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* VaccineAdministration

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ExportStatisticsUI
* ExportStatisticsController
* ExportSatistics
